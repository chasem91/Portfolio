### Bio

I'm a web developer based in NY. My most prominent skills are in Ruby, C++, JavaScript, Rails, React/Redux, PostgreSQL, HTML5 and CSS3. I'm currently looking for an engineering role where I can work with a passionate team and contribute to a bigger picture that I connect with in a meaningful way.
